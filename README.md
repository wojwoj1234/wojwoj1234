# Hi, I'm Wojtek! 👋



I’m 17 years old, and I’m passionate about web development 🌐💻. I started my front-end journey a few years ago when I discovered the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ✨. Since then, I’ve been honing my skills and learning new technologies such as React ⚛️.

I’m passionate about creating modern, responsive user interfaces, and I focus on writing clean, efficient code 👨‍💻. My goal is to build applications that not only work well but are also intuitive and user-friendly 😊.

In addition to programming, I’m interested in economics 💼📊 and UX/UI design 🎨, and I’m always eager to take on new challenges related to learning new technologies and frameworks 🚀.

Feel free to check out my projects and get in touch for collaboration! 🤝
